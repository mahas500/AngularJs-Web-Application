# AngularJs-Web-Application

# Probelm statement 
You have been hired by a car adverts business, and have been tasked to develop a
website that allows you to view a number of car adverts (develop a system to display at
least 10 records each record should have multiple images, etc.). You will work on the
layout of the website and allow for the user to navigate through various makes and
models and find the car they’re interested in. You should design the same for a mobile
device as well. The user should be able to lookup the advert based on make, model and
year of manufacture for the car, and view the details of each ad, using the print CSS.
The user should be able to contact the dealer using a contact form if they’re interested
in the ad.

# Solution Approach
The first step was to plan the website on a blank sheet. We decided
how many pages should be there. How the layout of the page should be. What sections
should be there? How the banner will be placed, which sections will be given more
importance etc. Then we moved on to deciding the grid of the car details. How many
cars should be displayed in each row, what should be the width of each grid etc.
The next step was to collect data for car adverts. We decided that we will have data of
20 Cars which will be stored in JSON (“JSON”) File. The brands which we selected are
Mercedes Benz, BMW, Audi, and Bentley. We extracted the data for cars from official
websites and found out some attractive images of each of these cars. We selected 5 cars
of each of the 4 brands and 5 images of each car.
